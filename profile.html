    <p>
      My name is Ixel, pronounced like "pixel" but without the letter p. I am now a Junior here at UNC, but I previously was at Aims Community College. 
      I am a very big basketball fan which is why I am pursing a degree in Sports Administration. While I do love that, I also have a passion for Law. 
      I hope after my undergrad I can move onto law school. I have a really cute dog named Lola. 
      I love Harry Potter as well Halloween which luckily go hand in hand for me.
