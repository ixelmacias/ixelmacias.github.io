    <h2>The Onion and their Satire</h2>

    <h2>Kids Imaginations'</h2>
    <p>I remember doing a project sometime in high school for an art class where we brought to life a childs "bad" drawing. We looked up some stuff online and I came across this website. I think it is super cute and funny how kids brains work and how we interpret things.</p>
