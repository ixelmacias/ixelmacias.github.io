    <h1>Internet Pages that Amuse Me</h1>
    <p>While I like to get my laughs from TV shows or movies, there are a few websites that still amuse me.</p>
    <h2>The Onion and their Satire</h2>
    <p>I think that the way we deliver news nowadays can be harsh and often taken out of context. While this isn't your best source of information it is still very intriguing. I sometimes come on here and browse when I am bored.</p>

    <h2>Kids and their Imagination</h2>
    <p>I remember doing a project sometime in high school for an art class where we brought to life a childs "bad" drawing. We looked up some stuff online and I came across this website. I think it is super cute and funny how kids brains work and how we interpret things.</p>

    <h2>Oh Adam Sandler</h2>
    <p>I am a very big Adam Sandler fan. I never miss a movie of his. I often post funny things on my social media and I like to refernece this page for all the funny movie quotes he has provided us for years.</p>
